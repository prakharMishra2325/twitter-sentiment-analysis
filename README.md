# twitter-sentiment-analysis

The purpose of this group project is to compare Twtiter's sentiment between the shows "Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power" and "Game of Thrones: House of the Dragon". (March '23)

It achieves this by using snscrape.modules.twitter for scraping and Vader Sentiment for sentiment analysis. My contributions include data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and working on the presentation (PPT and PDF included).
